The Rmd file here contains the code used to analyse data regarding the upload frequency of genomes to the CLIMB database by member organisations of the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium, between dates 03/03/2020, when the first publication occured, and 31/07/2021 of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Following preprocessing, this data was used to generate graph figures for the exhibition on the Consortium by Dr Lara Marks at WhatIsBiotechnology.org. The scripts for these graphs, along with some choice others, can also be found in this Rmd file, from line 234 onwards.

The script has been anonymised. If information is desired regarding the identities of the participant sequencing organisations and their positions with regard to these statistics feel free to contact me at danielpower1977@gmail.com, Dr Joshua Quick at j.quick@bham.ac.uk or Thomas Brier at t.o.brier@bham.ac.uk.

Additionally more information about the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium can be found at [the COG-UK homepage](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/), as well as at the exhibition by [WhatIsBiotechnology.org](https://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/index.php/exhibitions/coguk).
